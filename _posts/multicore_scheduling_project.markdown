description: I have created a CPU scheduling simulator program for a multi-core system environment. Each core simulates its own scheduling using separate threads within the program. I have implemented the round-robin CPU scheduling algorithm, introduced a CPU time clock for synchronization, and provided a visualization of the CPU scheduling process using Pyplot.
